Therefore, friends,As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,Whose soldier now, under whose blessed crossWe are impressed and engaged to fight,Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;Whose arms were moulded in their mothers\' wombTo chase these pagans in those holy fieldsOver whose acres walk\'d those blessed feetWhich fourteen hundred years ago were nail\'dFor our advantage on the bitter cross.But this our purpose now is twelve month old,And bootless \'tis to tell you we will go:Therefore we meet not now.

Only theyThat come to hear a merry bawdy play,A noise of targets, or to see a fellowIn a long motley coat guarded with yellow,Will be deceived; for, gentle hearers, know,To rank our chosen truth with such a showAs fool and fight is, beside forfeitingOur own brains, and the opinion that we bring,To make that only true we now intend,Will leave us never an understanding friend.Therefore, for goodness\' sake, and as you are knownThe first and happiest hearers of the town,Be sad, as we would make ye: think ye seeThe very persons of our noble storyAs they were living; think you see them great,And follow\'d with the general throng and sweatOf thousand friends; then in a moment, seeHow soon this mightiness meets misery:And, if you can be merry then, I\'ll sayA man may weep upon his wedding-day."

If you prick us, do we not bleed?if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poisonus, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we notrevenge? If we are like you in the rest, we willresemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christianwrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be byChristian example? Why, revenge. The villany youteach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but Iwill better the instruction."
